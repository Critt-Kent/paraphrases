# Paraphrases

This is a small experiment in which 50 fluent English speakers were asked to produce 4 increasingly remote paraphrases for two English sentences. The original and their paraphrases were uploaded to the CRITT TPR-DB and automatically word aligned. The Notebook illustrates that word translation entropy is higherin the more 'remote' paraphrases.
